# ImageDistraction
Distracts Blue Team by constantly opening up images.

Imagedistraction uses the user of the current user running the program, it grabs images from the user's images folder from either Windows or Linux(depending on which you grab). And than will open up roughly 25 to 200 images with 1 to 5 second intervals inbetween.

Usage: The Program must be uploaded to the intended computer and than ran, no command line arguements are necessary.

Note: Image Distraction Win.py Only works for Windows and will also only function if Python is on the machine it is running on. Please be careful with that knowledge.
